merging is a pain
reverting a specific file is a pain
errors are not very specific

cameron's image file added: c7Io3.jpg
Luke's image added: lemons.jpg

seemed to work well, i accidently added the .gitignore before eric got his image in so i guess he couldn't.

added image space.jpg
couldn't add to repo as images was already in the .gitignore, this is a great example of possible errors
that can happen.  According to certain sites .gitignore generally contain .exe files and image files, probably
javascript files and stuff that doesn't need updated or tracked.  Executable code is just regenerated locally
and not tracked.
